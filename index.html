        <p class="w3-justify">    When I just get introduced to the multi-agent system (MAS), in 2017, unsurprisingly there isn’t much introductory articles, blogs, or YouTube videos. MAS were still very much under-explored in literature. After all, we are still working on perfecting intelligent agent. We can surely thinking about connecting them later…… (I guess I’m not the only one who procrastinate) Well, unsurprisingly, lately OpenAI(need href) and Deepmind (need href) both investigate on doing research on MAS. Perhaps we are not very far away from coordinating a group of agents? </p>
        <p class="w3-justify">    Jacques Ferber defined that an agent can be a physical or virtual entity that can act, perceive its environment (in a partial way) and communicate with others, is autonomous and has skills to achieve its goals and tendencies. [Ferber, J. (1999). Multi-agent systems: an introduction to distributed artificial intelligence (Vol. 1). Reading: Addison-Wesley.] As you can tell, this is an extremely loose definition. This is because an agent can be instantiate in a lot of situations. // A common use would be digital society where each agent is considered an individual who are of some characteristics and interact with other individual as how they are defined. These agents can also work as a proxy of a party and negotiate with other agent in order to make a deal. The list goes on a on. // A multi-agent system put multiple agents in a predefined environment. The environment can be dynamic or static depends on the usage. The agent can also be connected in a specific topology. </p>

        <p class="w3-justify">Since I can not find a introductory post about MAS, I think it will be nice to create one. This post will use the example of a Prey Predator Model System to explore what is Multi-Agent System and it's other applications. Let's get started!</p>

        <h2 class="p3"><b>Agent Based Model (ABM) and Multi-Agent System:</b></h2>
        <p class="w3-justify">So, what is Multi-Agent System? To begin, let’s first talk about what is an agent.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">If one ever learned Java, or C ++, will know of a idea called Object Oriented Programming. An object can be an entity which contains some attribute and have some functions. This is very close to the idea of an agent. <b>Jacques Ferber </b>first<b> </b>defined that <em>an agent can be a physical or virtual entity that can act, <strong>perceive</strong> its environment (in a partial way) and <strong>communicate</strong> with others, is <strong>autonomous</strong> and <strong>has skills to achieve its goals</strong> and tendencies.</em><sup>1</sup> Below is a representation of an agent in a simulated environment. The agent is the blue dot (let's call it BLUE, I love cute names)  who only live if it's eats a green dot in a limited amount of time. As you can see, BLUE can perceive things (link with a highlighted beam) that are reasonably close to it. And the main goal for BLUE is to live and not die (as pretty much everyone is). BLUE can decide which grass to eat or just not eat and wondered around. Yes, the smell of freedom.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify">As you can tell, an agent is not so fun, seeing as it's just doing a thing that it suppose to do and not many variation is found. Same in real life, most stuff can not be accomplish by one person. Some tasks requires  to coordinate people, and in this case agents to fulfill.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">As you can tell, this is an extremely loose definition. The looseness came from that an agent can be instantiate in a lot of situations. // A common use would be digital society where each agent is considered an individual who are of some characteristics and interact with other individual as how they are defined. These agents can also work as a proxy of a party and negotiate with other agent in order to make a deal. The list goes on a on. // A multi-agent system put multiple agents in a predefined environment. The environment can be dynamic or static depends on the usage. The agent can also be connected in a specific topology.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Enough of definitions, let’s talk about the idea with a specific example.</p>
        <p class="p3"><b>Prey Predator Model: </b></p>
        <p class="p3"><b>Intro to prey and predator model</b></p>
